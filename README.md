# spp-tools (Simple Python Password Tools)
A simple Python3-based tools list.

## Notes about verbosity in spg
When you put the verbosity to 1 (adding '-v 1' to the command line), you have 2 maps printed :
	
	- The first one is the shuffled char set
	- The second one are the indexes used to pick-up chars in the previous map

I don't see any interest in printing these maps but maybe you will.
